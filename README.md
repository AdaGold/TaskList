### Reflection on the TaskListProject
#What went well - 
# I fee I had a better idea on how to get started on a larger rails project than I did with the projects earlier in the week. 
#What I am still working on understanding better how all the moving parts fit in, flow, and effect one another. Rails feels like a large kinetic sculputure where moving one part moves and requires augmentation of several others that are not intuitively (at this time) related. 
#My partner used a toggle button to in the completion view and made the Date time much more human readable. It looks good and took about 5 lines to do.
